Curse Instance Tutorial
=======================

Introduction
============

Welcome to the CurseInstance(CI) tutorial!

This tutorial aims to give you an understanding of
CIs, and how to use them efficiently!
In the previous tutorial, you should 
have read about the HandlerCollection,
and it's entry points.
You should have noticed some talk about CurseInstances,
which will be covered in great detail in this document.

What is a CurseInstance?
========================

A 'CurseInstance' is a class that represents 
CurseForge(CF) information.

For example, 
the CurseAddon class contains info such as
the addon name, slug, id, release date, ect.

You can access the name of the addon like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # Print the name of the addon
    # (Assume 'addon' is a valid CurseAddon instance)

    print(addon.name)

CIs also offer convince methods for interacting with said data.
These convenience methods automatically make the necessary 
HandlerCollection calls with the correct arguments to get the relevant data.

.. note::

    You should have already read the :ref:`CurseClient tutorial <collec_basic>`.
    If you haven't, you should really check it out,
    as CurseClient is a very important class!

Why CurseInstances?
-------------------

CurseInstances are in place to normalize CF data.
They ensure that no matter what the capy configuration is,
your program will always interact with the same classes.
If this were not the case, 
then the end user using capy would have to 
determine what format the raw data being is in,
and how to decode it.
Because capy is modular, this data can be literally anything!
So having a standardized way to get this data is very important.

CIs also provide all addon info in a convent way.
Most users do not want to manually parse request data!

Finally, CI's convenience methods make using capy much easier.
As stated earlier, these methods take the steps to automatically 
get extra info.
This makes the end user's life much easier,
and allows for a more pythonic, class-based way
of interacting with CF.

CI's use the entry point methods of the CC that returned them.
This means that they expect the handlers at the given location 
to accept the standard arguments,
and return the standard objects.

You shouldn't have to create CI's yourself,
as the handlers you load should do this for you.
The only time you should create CI's are if you are writing a handler!
If you ever find yourself in a position where you have to create a CI,
then you can pass arguments in the order they are documented,
or have a look at the API reference.

Creating CurseInstances
-----------------------

CurseInstances inherit the python `dataclass object <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.
This means that many components present in curse instances are implemented by the dataclass module,
including the 'init' function and instantiation.
This means that the init function is not explicitly defined,
but is instead generated by the dataclass module.
The order of parameters documented is the order that they must be provided 
to instantiate a dataclass.
For example, if the parameters of a dataclass by the name of 'DummyInstance' is documented like this:

* arg1 - First argument
* arg2 - Second argument 
* arg3 - Third argument 

Then you will instantiate the class like so:

.. code-block:: python 

    inst = DummyInstance(1, 2, 3)

Where '1' will be set to 'arg1', 
'2' will be set to 'arg2',
and so on.

ALL arguments specified are required.
It is highly recommended that you look at the `dataclass module documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_,
and you should check out the API reference for CurseInstances for more info. 

Types of CurseInstances
=======================

We will now go through each CI,
and lay out there parameters and methods.

More info can be found in the API reference for CIs.

.. note::

    For all coming examples,
    assume that 'inst' is a valid CurseInstance
    of the type being described.

Before we gte into CI types,
we will first go over common features every CI has.

Every CI should have attributes which store the raw data and metadata of the request.
Raw data is the raw, unprocessed data from the protocol object.
This is usually bytes that are encoded in some format.
Raw data should really only be touched by people who need it!
It is already decoded and put into a format that is accessible
(The CI).
Note that not all handlers attach this raw data,
so be warned!

Metadata is extra data provided by the protocol object.
For example, the URLProtocol object provides status codes, request headers,
reason strings, ect. about the HTTP connection.
This data can be useful if you are interested in connection stats.
Again, not all handlers attach this metadata, so be warned!

Here is an example of printing both values:

.. code-block::

    # Print the raw data:

    print(inst.raw)

    # Print the meta data:

    print(inst.meta)

Extra Functionality
-------------------

Some CIs have extra functionality 
that allows them to do extra things,
such as write content to an external file,
or download data from a remote source to a custom file.

Writer
______

A CI with writer functionality will allow you to write content 
to an external file.
You can invoke this process by using the 'write' method:

.. code-block:: python

    inst.write(PATH, append=False)

Where 'PATH' is a path like object giving the pathname
of the file to be written to.
You can also specify if the content is to be 
appended to the external file by using the 'append' parameter.

The CI determines what will be written to the external file.
If a CI has this feature,
then we will go over what exactly they write in this tutorial.

Downloader
__________

A CI with downloader functionality will allow 
you to download external content and write it to a file.
You can invoke this process by using the 'download' method:

.. code-block:: python

    inst.download(PATH)

Where 'PATH', like in the writer,
is a path like object giving the pathname of the file to be written to.

Again, the CI determines what will be downloaded and written to the external file.
If a CI has this feature, then we will go over exactly what they download and write.

CurseAttachment
---------------

Represents an attachment on CF.

* title - Title of the attachment
* id - ID of the attachment
* thumb_url - URL to the thumbnail of the attachment
    (If the attachment is an image, then the thumbnail is a smaller version of the image)
* url - URL of the attachment 
* is_thumbnail - Boolean determining if this attachment is a thumbnail of an addon 
* addon_id - ID this addon is apart of 
* description - Description of this attachment 

CurseAttachments have the download feature,
which means that you can download this attachment using the 'download' method:

.. code-block:: python 

    data = inst.download()

This will download the raw bytes and return them.
If you want to write this content to a file,
then you can pass a path to the 'path' parameter, like so:

.. code-block:: python 

    written = inst.download('path/to/file.jpg')

Where 'written' will be the number of bytes written.
If you provide a directory instead of a file to write,
then we will automatically use the default name
as the file to write to.
You can also download the thumbnail using the 'download_thumbnail' method,
which operates in the same way.

CurseDescription
----------------

Represents a description on CF.
This description can be any HTMl text!

* description - Raw HTML description text
* formatter - Formatter attached to this description.

The stored description is usually in HTML.
This may make interpreting and displaying the description difficult.
To alleviate this problem, CurseDescription allows for the registration 
of formatters that can change or alter the text.
A formatter is a class that alters the description into something new.
You can register valid formatters using the 'attach_formatter' method:

.. code-block:: python 

    inst.attach_formatter(FORM)

Where 'FORM' is the formatter to attach.
If the formatter is invalid, then we raise a TypeError exception.
A formatter is valid if it inherits the 'BaseFormat' class.

HandlerCollection objects can automatically attach formatters to
CurseDescription objects if specified.
You can pass a valid formatter to the 'default_formatter()'
method on the HC, and the formatter will be attached
to every CurseDescription object returned.

Here is a list of all built in formatters:

* NullFormatter - Does nothing!
* StripHTML - Strips all HTML elements, leaving(In theory) valid text.
* BSFormatter - Loads the HTML data into beautiful soup for further parsing.
    This formatter returns a bs4 instance, and beautiful soup MUST be installed,
    or an exception will be raised!

Here is an example of setting a StripHTML as the default
formatter for a HC:

.. code-block:: python 

    hc.default_formatter(StripHTML())

Where 'hc' is a valid HandlerCollection object.

To get the formatted content, you can use the format method:

.. code-block:: python

    cont = desc.format()

Where 'desc' is a valid CurseDescription object.
'format' will send the description thorough the formatter,
and return the content the formatter provides.

You can also create your own custom formatters as well.
Just inherit the 'BaseFormatter' class, and overload the 'format' method.
The 'format' method should return the formatted content.

Here is an example of a custom formatter that appends 'Super Slick!' to the end of the description:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import BaseFormat:

    from capy.formatters import BaseFormat
        
    class SuperFormatter(BaseFormat):

        def format(self, data: str) -> str:
            """
            Returns the description, but with 
            'Super Slick!' appended to the end.
            """

            return data + 'Super Slick!'

    # Attach to a CurseDescription object:

    desc.attach_formatter(SuperFormatter())

CurseDescription objects can write content to an external file,
as it has writing functionality. 

CurseAuthor
-----------

Represents an author on CF.

* id - ID of the author 
* name - Name of the author
* url - URL to the authors page 

CurseAuthor classes is not necessary for CF development,
and only acts as extra info if you want it.

CurseGame
---------

Represents a game on CF.

* name - Name of the game
* slug - Slug of the game 
* id - ID of the game 
* support_addons - Boolean determining if the game supports addons
* cat_ids - List of root category ID's associated with the game

The CurseGame instance does not have valid classes representing the root level catagories,
only there ID's.
If you want to retrieve the objects that represent the catagories,
you can use the 'categories' method to retrieve category info like so:

.. code-block:: python

    cats = inst.catagories()

This will return a tuple of CurseCatagories objects representing each root category.

CurseCategory
-------------

Represents a CurseCategory,
and provides methods for getting sub and parent catagories.

* id - ID of the catagory
* game_id - ID of the game the category is associated with 
* name - Name of the category
* root_id - ID of this objects root category(None if there is no root ID)
* parent_id - ID of this objects parent category(None if there is no root ID)
* icon - Icon of the category(CurseAttachment)
* date - Date this category was created

If you read the into tutorial
(You did read the into tutorial right?),
then you will know that catagories can have
parent and sub-catagories.
CurseCategory objects have methods for traveling
though the hierarchy,
and each returns CurseCategory objects representing
these catagories.

'sub_categories()' returns a tuple of 
CurseCategory objects representing each sub-category,
returns an empty tuple if there is no sub-categories.

'parent_category()' returns a CurseCategory object 
representing the parent category, returns
None if there is no root category.

'root_category()' returns a CurseCategory object 
representing the root category, returns
None if there is no root category.

CurseAddon also makes searching a breeze.
We automatically provide the correct game and category ID's.
Users can provide a 'SearchParameter' object for 
fine-tuning the search operation.

You can use the 'search' method to get a list of valid addons.
You can also use the 'iter_search' method to iterate 
over each addon. 

.. note::

CurseAddon 
----------

Represents an addon on CurseForge.

* name - Name of the addon 
* slug - Slug of the addon 
* summary - Summary of the addon(Not a full description, 
* url - URL of the addon page 
* lang - Language of the addon
* date_created - Date this addon was created 
* date_modified - Date this addon was last modified 
* date_release - Date the addons latest release 
* ID - ID of this addon 
* download_count - Number of times this addon has been downloaded
* game_id - ID of the game this addon is in 
* available - Boolean determining if the addon is available 
* experimental - Boolean determining if the addon is experimental 
* authors - Tuple of CurseAuthor instances for this addon
* attachments - Tuple of CurseAttachments associated with the object 
* category_id - ID of the category this addon is in 
* is_featured - Boolean determining if this addon is featured 
* popularity_score - Float representing this popularity score(Most likely used for ranking)
* popularity_rank - int representing the addon game's popularity 
* game_name - Name of the game 

CurseAddon objects do not keep the description info!
A special call must be made to retrieve this.
CurseAddon offers a property that that can retrieve the description 
as a CurseDescription object:

.. code-block:: python

    desc = inst.description 

You can get the files associated with this addon by using the 'file' method:

.. code-block:: python 

    file = inst.file(ID)

Where ID is the ID of the file to retrieve.
This method returns a CurseFile object representing the files
(We will go over CurseFile objects later in this tutorial!).
If you want a list of all files associated with the addon, 
you can use the 'files()' method,
which returns a tuple of CurseFile objects.

You can retrieve the CurseGame object representing the game
this addon is apart of using the 'game' method. You can also get a CurseCategory 
object representing the category this addon is apart of
by using the 'category' method:

.. code-block:: python 

    # Get the game:

    game = inst.game()

    # Get the category:

    cat = inst.category()

CurseFile 
---------

Represents a file on CF.

* id - ID of the file 
* addon_id - ID of the addon this file is apart of 
* display_name - Display name of the file 
* file_name - File name of the file
* date - Date the file was uploaded
* download_url - Download URL of the file 
* length - Length in bytes of the file 
* version - Version of the game needed to work this file 
* dependencies - List of dependence IDs 

To get the changelog of the file,
you can use the 'changelog' property:

.. code-block:: python 

    desc = inst.changelog 

This will return a CurseCategory object representing the description.
As stated earlier, 
CI's use the entry point methods of the HC that returned them.
This means that the CurseDescription object will have the default formatter 
attached to it.

If you want all addon dependencies this file requires, you can use the 
'get_dependencies()' method, which will return a tuple of CurseAddon 
objects representing the dependencies.
If there are no dependencies,
then the returned tuple will be empty.

You can also get the 'get_addon()' method to retrieve a CurseAddon 
object representing the addon this file is attached to.

The CurseFile class also has download functionality.
You can use the 'download()' method to download this 
file.
