Welcome to the Basic Usage Tutorial!
====================================

In this series, we will be covering concepts such as
CurseClient objects, Curse Instances, and other 
capy concepts that are important to understand.

We will be going into simple concepts that allow you to simply
use capy for interacting with CurseForge.
In other words, we will be keeping the topics covered here at a surface level only.

If you want to gain a deeper understanding of capy,
and learn how to customize it's internals for your custom use cases,
then you should check out the :ref:`Advanced Tutorial<advanced-tutorial>`.
