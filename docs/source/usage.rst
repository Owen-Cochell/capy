Introduction
============

This section of the documentation outlines
tutorials for using and working with capy on the surface level.
We will not get into advanced concepts like handler development,
and will instead stick to surface concepts.

In this tutorial,
we will go over capy basics,
handler collection objects,
and curse instances.
This will give you a good idea on how to utilise capy.
