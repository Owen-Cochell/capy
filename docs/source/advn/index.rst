Welcome to the advanced capy tutorial!

We will go over advanced capy concepts 
such as handler development, writing wrappers,
and working with protocol objects.

The concepts included in this tutorial 
are not strictly necessary for using capy!
You can get away with using default capy settings
and handlers.
However, if you wish to gain a deeper understanding
of capy's internals, and how you can configure them
to work well for you, then this tutorial
should be an excellent way for you to do that.
