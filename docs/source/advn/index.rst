Welcome to the Advanced cursepy Tutorial!
=========================================

We will go over advanced cursepy concepts 
such as handler development, cursepy design, philosophy,
and advanced handler management.

.. warning::
    The topics covered in this tutorial can be somewhat complicated!

The concepts included in this tutorial 
are not strictly necessary for using cursepy.
You can get away with using default cursepy settings
and handlers.
However, if you wish to gain a deeper understanding
of cursepy's internals and how to configure it
to work well for you, then this tutorial
should be an excellent way for you to do that!

If this is too complicated to understand, then you should check out 
the :ref:`Basic Usage Tutorial<basic-tutorial>`.
